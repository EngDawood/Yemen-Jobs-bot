### Using the official bot instance

The [RSS-ify bot](https://t.me/rssifyxbot) comes with absolute no warranty. I will try my best to maintain it, but I won't guarantee that it will always work perfectly. Meanwhile, you should "fair use" the bot, avoid subscribing to too many RSS feeds.

## Attribution

This project is a fork of [Yemen-Jobs-bot](https://github.com/EngDawood/Yemen-Jobs-bot.git) by EngDawood. Significant modifications and enhancements have been made to adapt it for RSS feed delivery.
