# Product Context: RSS-ify

## Problem Solved
In a world with vast amounts of information, staying updated with various sources (blogs, news sites, etc.) can be overwhelming. Users often have to manually check multiple websites, which is time-consuming and inefficient. RSS-ify solves this by centralizing RSS feed updates into a single, convenient platform: Telegram.

## How It Works
RSS-ify acts as a personal news aggregator within Telegram. Users subscribe to their favorite RSS feeds through simple commands. The bot then periodically checks these feeds for new content and pushes the updates directly to the user, either in a private message or a group chat.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: The bot should be easy to use with intuitive commands.
- **Efficiency**: Provide a streamlined way to consume content from multiple sources without leaving Telegram.
- **Control**: Users should have full control over their subscriptions, with easy ways to add, remove, and view them.
- **Lightweight**: The bot should be fast and responsive, without unnecessary features.
